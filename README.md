### 💼 Experience

- Specialized in recursive regression — both emotional and statistical.  
- Invented three new buzzwords per quarter. Usage pending.  
- Designed dashboards nobody asked for. Pixel-perfect though.

### 🧠 Currently Learning

- Industrial Confusion & Inconvenience Engineering  
- `git push --force && hope`  
- Verbose Abstraction (esp. cubic regression, occasionally feelings)  
- Liquification (undefined behavior)  
- Analytical Analysis (because we *can*, not because we *should*)  
- Rats. Yes. The actual ones.  
- If “nonsense” hits GitHub Trending, I’m switching to Arch.  
  > *(Already did. Broke my audio drivers.)*

### 🪛 Tools & Philosophy

- I use **Windows** — not because it's the best, but because uninstalling Zune or Copilot breaks the sound drivers.  
- I use **TypeScript**, mostly to sass JavaScript.  
- I write **Go backends** in **Express**. Yes, really.  
- I use **NeonVim** (inside VSCode — it's slower, but I can paste with one key).  
- My PC has been updating since the Renaissance.
