ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @devalentineomonya, currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Kirinyaga University.
ðŸŒ± In my years of study , I've developed a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, operating systems, and networking.
ðŸ’¡ Passionate about learning, I've delved into various programming languages, including Python. I've honed my skills in 
web development using frameworks like Flask and Django, as well as mastering technologies like Kivy, Tkinter, and Ttkbootstrap.
ðŸš€ Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I aspire to apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems in technology and other fields.
